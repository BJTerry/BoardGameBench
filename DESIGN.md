# LLM Game Evaluation Framework Design

See CONVENTIONS.md for coding style and practices to follow when implementing components.

## Architecture Overview

The framework enables systematic evaluation of LLM game-playing capabilities through a modular, extensible architecture.

### Core Components

1. Game Engine
   - Abstract Game interface defining core game mechanics
   - Game-specific state classes with type hints
   - Strict move validation
   - Player views through GameView with configurable prompt styles

2. LLM Integration
   - Unified interface for OpenRouter and OpenAI models
   - Advanced conversation management with history tracking
   - Robust move parsing with chain-of-thought support
   - Configurable system prompts and response styles
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

3. Game Implementations
   - NimGame, BattleshipGame, WarGame with consistent interfaces
   - Type-safe state management
   - Clear validation rules
   - Detailed game history tracking
   See GAME_CONTRIBUTIONS.md for detailed implementation guidelines.

4. Arena System
   - Automated match scheduling
   - Elo rating calculations
   - Confidence-based match termination
   - Comprehensive experiment tracking

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Game State & Views

Each game provides:
- Strongly typed state management
- Configurable view formatting (JSON/XML/Text)
- Detailed move validation
- Comprehensive game history
- Clear win condition tracking

### 2. LLM Integration

Advanced integration features:
- Multiple response styles (Direct/Chain-of-thought)
- Configurable prompt formatting
- Model-specific optimizations
- Detailed interaction logging
- Performance metrics tracking

### 3. Database Integration

Comprehensive experiment tracking:
- Full game history
- Player statistics
- LLM interaction details
- Performance metrics
- Rating progression

### Testing Architecture

1. **Framework Components**
   - pytest with async support
   - Comprehensive fixture system
   - Controlled test environments
   - Detailed failure logging

2. **LLM Testing**
   - TestModel for deterministic LLM simulation
   - Message flow capture and verification
   - System prompt consistency validation
   - Error condition simulation

3. **Integration Testing**
