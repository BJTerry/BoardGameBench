            "Azul is a tile-placement game where players compete to create the most beautiful mosaic on their wall by "
            "selecting and arranging colored tiles.\n\n"
            "## Game Components\n"
            "- 5 colors of tiles (blue, yellow, red, black, and white), 20 of each color\n"
            "- Factory displays (circular areas containing 4 tiles each)\n"
            "- Center area (where remaining tiles from factories go)\n"
            "- First player marker (taken by the first player to select from the center)\n"
            "- Player boards with:\n"
            "  - Pattern lines (rows of increasing length 1-5 that hold tiles before placing on the wall)\n"
            "  - Wall (5×5 grid with a specific color arrangement where tiles are permanently placed)\n"
            "  - Floor line (penalty area for excess tiles)\n\n"
            "## Game Structure\n"
            "The game consists of multiple rounds, each with two phases:\n"
            "1. Factory Offer Phase (selecting tiles)\n"
            "2. Wall-Tiling Phase (placing tiles and scoring)\n\n"
            "## Detailed Turn Sequence\n\n"
            "### Factory Offer Phase\n"
            "On your turn, you must:\n\n"
            "1. Select tiles by doing ONE of the following:\n"
            "   - Take ALL tiles of ONE color from ONE factory display AND move all remaining tiles to the center\n"
            "   - Take ALL tiles of ONE color from the center\n\n"
            "2. If you take tiles from the center and the first player marker is there, you must take it and place it "
            "on your floor line (this counts as a negative point).\n\n"
            "3. Place all your selected tiles onto ONE of your pattern lines according to these rules:\n"
            "   - Each pattern line can only contain tiles of a single color\n"
            "   - Pattern lines fill from right to left (row 1 can hold 1 tile, row 2 can hold 2 tiles, etc.)\n"
            "   - You cannot place tiles in a pattern line if the corresponding color is already on your wall in that row\n"
            "   - You cannot place tiles in a pattern line that already contains a different color\n"
            "   - Any tiles that don't fit must go to your floor line\n"
            "   - If you don't want to or cannot place tiles in a pattern line, you can put them directly on your floor line\n\n"
            "The Factory Offer Phase ends when all tiles have been taken from factories and the center.\n\n"
            "### Wall-Tiling Phase\n"

            "1. For each COMPLETELY filled pattern line (no empty spaces):\n"
            "   - Move the rightmost tile to the matching position on your wall\n"
            "   - The wall has a fixed color pattern (each row and column can only have one of each color)\n"
            "   - Score points for each tile placed (see scoring rules below)\n"
            "   - Discard the remaining tiles from that pattern line to the discard pile\n\n"
            "2. Incomplete pattern lines (with empty spaces) remain for the next round\n\n"
            "3. Score penalties for your floor line:\n"

            "- If the tile is ISOLATED (no adjacent tiles): 1 point\n"
            "- If the tile forms a HORIZONTAL group: 1 point per tile in the connected horizontal line (including the new tile)\n"
            "- If the tile forms a VERTICAL group: 1 point per tile in the connected vertical line (including the new tile)\n"
            "- If both horizontal and vertical: Score BOTH lines\n\n"
