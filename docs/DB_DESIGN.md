# Database Schema Enhancement Plan

## Status Update
✅ Completed:
1. Core schema updates for Game, Player, and LLMInteraction tables
2. NOT NULL constraints on foreign keys
3. Basic relationships between entities
4. Initial test coverage for basic operations
5. Game outcome tracking implementation
6. Test coverage for game outcomes
7. Player-experiment relationship validation

🏗️ In Progress:
1. Game result analysis methods
2. Concession handling

❌ Not Started:
1. Performance metrics

## Remaining Implementation - Phase 1

### Test Coverage Gaps
1. **Game Player Relationships**
   - Test game creation with invalid player combinations
   - Test player reassignment scenarios
   - Verify experiment isolation

2. **Player-Experiment Association**
   - Test player creation edge cases
   - Verify experiment constraints
   - Test player lookup methods

3. **LLM Interaction Attribution**
   - Test interaction recording failure cases
   - Verify player attribution constraints
   - Test interaction queries

## Phase 2: Game Outcome Implementation

### Next Steps
1. **GameRunner Updates**
   - Add winner recording logic
   - Implement basic game completion tracking
   - Add game status flags

2. **Test Cases**
   - Test normal win scenarios
   - Test draw conditions
   - Test basic queries

## Phase 3: Basic Reporting

### Implementation Priority
1. **Core Query Methods**
   ```python
   class Experiment:
       def get_game_results(self) -> List[Dict]:
           """Get basic results for completed games."""

       def get_player_stats(self, player_id: int) -> Dict:
           """Get basic stats for a player."""
   ```

### Test Cases
1. **Result Queries**
   - Test game result retrieval
   - Test player statistics
   - Test error cases

## Success Criteria
- All games properly track both players
- Basic game outcomes recorded
- LLM interactions properly attributed
- Complete test coverage of core functionality
- Documentation updated to match implementation

## Next Actions
1. Complete remaining Phase 1 tests
2. Implement basic game outcome tracking
3. Add core result queries
4. Update documentation

## Implementation Sequence
1. Fix any remaining test gaps
2. Complete GameRunner updates
3. Add basic reporting
4. Update documentation
