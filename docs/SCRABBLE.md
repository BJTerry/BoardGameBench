 # Scrabble Game Implementation Plan

 ## Overview

 This document outlines the steps to implement a two-player version of Scrabble within the existing game framework. The implementation will adhere to the rules provided and ensure that the game integrates smoothly with the platform's architecture.

 ## Implementation Steps

 1. **Define Game State and Move Structures**
    - Create data classes for the game state, including the board, player tiles, and scores.
    - Define a structure for moves, capturing the word, position, and direction.

 2. **Initialize Game State**
    - Implement the `get_initial_state` method to set up the board, distribute tiles, and initialize scores.

 3. **Implement Move Parsing and Validation**
    - Develop the `parse_move` method to convert LLM responses into move objects.
    - Implement `validate_move` to ensure moves are legal, including word validation against the provided word list.
    - **Fixed:** Validation logic correctly handles multiple tiles of the same letter during exchanges.
    - **Fixed:** Validation properly checks that the player has the necessary letters to make the move, considering connections with existing words.

 4. **Apply Moves and Update State**
    - Implement `apply_move` to update the board and scores based on valid moves.
    - Ensure proper handling of special tiles (double/triple letter/word scores).
    - **Fixed:** Removed redundant `pass_turn` call and reset `consecutive_passes` only in `apply_move` when it's not a pass.
    - **Fixed:** Only score words that are formed or modified by the current move, not existing words on the board.

 5. **Manage Player Turns and Game Progression**
    - Implement `get_current_player` to manage turn order.
    - Develop logic to handle tile exchanges and passing turns.
    - **Fixed:** Correctly handle `consecutive_passes` in `pass_turn`.

 6. **Determine Game End and Winner**
    - Implement `is_terminal` to check for game-ending conditions.
    - Develop `get_winner` to determine the winner based on final scores.

 7. **Ensure Player Views and Hidden Information**
    - Implement `get_player_view` to provide each player with a view of the board and their tiles.
    - Include `move_format_instructions` in the `GameView` to guide the LLM on how to play the game.
    - Ensure the `GameView` encapsulates the visible state, valid moves, and other necessary information as per `game_view.py`.
    - **Fixed:** Include whether the last player passed in the visible state.

 8. **Testing and Validation**
    - Create unit tests to verify game logic, including move validation and scoring.
    - Simulate games to ensure correct behavior and adherence to rules.
    - **Added Tests:** Verified that multiple tiles of the same letter can be exchanged correctly.
    - **Added Tests:** Verified that only words formed or modified by the current move are scored.

 9. **Complete Rule Summary**
    - Update the rules explanation to provide a comprehensive summary of Scrabble rules.
    - **Fixed:** Explicitly stated that only words formed or modified by the current move are scored.

    - [x] Implement word validation for all connected words

 ## Notes

 - The word list is loaded from `data/scrabble-dict.txt` and used for move validation.
 - The LLM will not receive the list of correct words; it will only be used to check the LLM's responses.
 - The game is implemented as a subclass of the `Game` interface, following the architecture guidelines in `DESIGN.md`.
 - Refer to `GAME_CONTRIBUTIONS.md` for detailed guidance on setting up `GameView` and ensuring proper player views.
 - According to official Scrabble rules, you only score for words formed or modified by your current move, not for existing words on the board that aren't modified.
